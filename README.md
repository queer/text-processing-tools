# text processing tools

Tools I build for myself over time to process text data via stdin/out.

## Tools

- [`utt` (Java)](https://github.com/queer/utt): The universal text transformer, pipe data to stdin, optionally map with javascript, transform to another format, pipe to stdout.
- [`hl` (Rust)](https://github.com/queer/hl): A little tool to highlight code on the command line.
- [`de(c)ompressor` (Rust)](https://github.com/queer/decompressor): Automatically decompress and optionally recompress streams of compressed data at the command line; supports multiple formats + autodetection of input stream type.
- [`rgb` (Rust)](https://github.com/queer/rgb): Process `#rrggbb` colours in the terminal, get HSV, ranges, and more.
